# Stat628-Module3-Group10

This project is the coursework for STAT 628, instructed by Prof. Hyunseung Kang, in which we built a shine app to provide suggestions for burger resturants owners through the yelp reviews. You can find the final app  at [Rating My burger Shops](https://jiawei98.shinyapps.io/UI_module3/).


## Summary
Summary_Module_3_Group10.pdf is a summary of what we did. The results show that the restaurant rating is affected by both the reviews and restaurant attributes.

There are four folders providing more details in our main project: *slides*, *code*, *data*, *summary*.

## Files and Folders
